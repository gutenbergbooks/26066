<h1><big><i>The Cosmic Express</i></big></h1>

<h2>By JACK WILLIAMSON</h2>

<h2>Introduction by Sam Moskowitz</h2>

<p class="cap"><i><span class="dcap">The</span> year 1928 was a great
year of discovery for</i> <span class="smcap">AMAZING
STORIES</span>. <i>They were uncovering
new talent at such a great rate,
(Harl Vincent, David H. Keller,
E. E. Smith, Philip Francis Nowlan,
Fletcher Pratt and Miles J.
Breuer), that Jack Williamson
barely managed to become one of
a distinguished group of discoveries
by stealing the cover of the
December issue for his first story</i>
The Metal Man.</p>

<p><i>A disciple of A. Merritt, he attempted
to imitate in style, mood
and subject the magic of that
late lamented master of fantasy.
The imitation found great favor
from the readership and almost
instantly Jack Williamson became
an important name on the
contents page of</i> <span class="smcap">AMAZING STORIES</span>.
<i>He followed his initial success
with two short novels</i>, The
Green Girl <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">AMAZING STORIES</span>
<i>and</i> The Alien Intelligence <i>in</i>
<span class="smcap">SCIENCE WONDER STORIES</span>, <i>another
Gernsback publication. Both of
these stories were close copies of
A. Merritt, whose style and method
Jack Williamson parlayed into
popularity for eight years.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet the strange thing about it
was that Jack Williamson was
one of the most versatile science
fiction authors ever to sit down
at the typewriter. When the
vogue for science-fantasy altered
to super science, he created the
memorable super lock-picker
Giles Habilula as the major attraction
in a rousing trio of space
operas</i>, The Legion of Space, The
Cometeers <i>and</i> One Against the
Legion. <i>When grim realism was
the order of the day, he produced</i>
Crucible of Power <i>and when they
wanted extrapolated theory in
present tense, he assumed the
disguise of Will Stewart and
popularized the concept of contra
terrene matter in science fiction
with</i> Seetee Ship <i>and</i> Seetee
Shock. <i>Finally, when only psychological
studies of the future
would do, he produced</i> "With
Folded Hands ..." "... And
Searching Mind."</p>

<p>The Cosmic Express <i>is of special
interest because it was written
during Williamson's A. Merritt
"kick," when he was writing
little else but, and it gave the
earliest indication of a more general
capability. The lightness of
the handling is especially modern,
barely avoiding the farcical
by the validity of the notion that
wireless transmission of matter
is the next big transportation
frontier to be conquered. It is
especially important because it
stylistically forecast a later trend
to accept the background for
granted, regardless of the quantity
of wonders, and proceed with
the story. With only a few thousand
scanning-disk television sets
in existence at the time of the
writing, the surmise that this
media would be a natural for
westerns was particularly astute.</i></p>

<p><i>Jack Williamson was born in
1908 in the Arizona territory
when covered wagons were the
primary form of transportation
and apaches still raided the settlers.
His father was a cattle
man, but for young Jack, the
ranch was anything but glamorous.
"My days were filled," he remembers,
"with monotonous
rounds of what seemed an endless,
heart-breaking war with
drought and frost and dust-storms,
poison-weeds and hail,
for the sake of survival on the</i>
Llano Estacado." <i>The discovery
of</i> <span class="smcap">AMAZING STORIES</span> <i>was the escape
he sought and his goal was
to be a science fiction writer. He
labored to this end and the first
he knew that a story of his had
been accepted was when he
bought the December, 1929 issue
of</i> <span class="smcap">AMAZING STORIES</span>. <i>Since then,
he has written millions of words
of science fiction and has gone on
record as follows: "I feel that
science-fiction is the folklore of
the new world of science, and
the expression of man's reaction
to a technological environment.
By which I mean that it is the
most interesting and stimulating
form of literature today."</i></p>

<hr class="tb1" />
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding</span>
tumbled out of the
rumpled bed-clothing, a striking
slender figure in purple-striped
pajamas. He smiled fondly across
to the other of the twin beds,
where Nada, his pretty bride,
lay quiet beneath light silk covers.
With a groan, he stood up
and began a series of fantastic
bending exercises. But after a
few half-hearted movements, he
gave it up, and walked through
an open door into a small bright
room, its walls covered with bookcases
and also with scientific appliances
that would have been
strange to the man of four or
five centuries before, when the
Age of Aviation was beginning.</p>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/001.png" width="199" height="177" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/002.png" width="394" height="306" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>Suddenly there was a sharp tingling
sensation where they touched
the polished surface.</small></b></div>

<p>Yawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding
stood before the great
open window, staring out. Below
him was a wide, park-like space,
green with emerald lawns, and
bright with flowering plants.
Two hundred yards across it rose
an immense pyramidal building&mdash;an
artistic structure, gleaming
with white marble and bright
metal, striped with the verdure
of terraced roof-gardens,
its slender peak rising to
help support the gray, steel-ribbed
glass roof above. Beyond,
the park stretched away in
illimitable vistas, broken with
the graceful columned buildings
that held up the great glass roof.</p>

<p>Above the glass, over this New
York of 2432 A. D., a freezing
blizzard was sweeping. But small
concern was that to the lightly
clad man at the window, who was
inhaling deeply the fragrant air
from the plants below&mdash;air kept,
winter and summer, exactly at
20&deg; C.</p>

<p>With another yawn, Mr. Eric
Stokes-Harding turned back to
the room, which was bright with
the rich golden light that poured
in from the suspended globes of
the cold ato-light that illuminated
the snow-covered city.
With a distasteful grimace, he
seated himself before a broad,
paper-littered desk, sat a few
minutes leaning back, with his
hands clasped behind his head.
At last he straightened reluctantly,
slid a small typewriter
out of its drawer, and began
pecking at it impatiently.</p>

<p>For Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding
was an author. There was a whole
shelf of his books on the wall, in
bright jackets, red and blue and
green, that brought a thrill of
pleasure to the young novelist's
heart when he looked up from his
clattering machine.</p>

<p>He wrote "thrilling action romances,"
as his enthusiastic publishers
and television directors
said, "of ages past, when men
were men. Red-blooded heroes responding
vigorously to the stirring
passions of primordial life!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> was impartial as to the
source of his thrills&mdash;provided
they were distant enough
from modern civilization. His
hero was likely to be an ape-man
roaring through the jungle, with
a bloody rock in one hand and
a beautiful girl in the other.
Or a cowboy, "hard-riding, hard-shooting,"
the vanishing hero of
the ancient ranches. Or a man
marooned with a lovely woman
on a desert South Sea island.
His heroes were invariably
strong, fearless, resourceful fellows,
who could handle a club on
equal terms with a cave-man, or
call science to aid them in defending
a beautiful mate from
the terrors of a desolate wilderness.</p>

<p>And a hundred million read
Eric's novels, and watched the
dramatization of them on the
television screens. They thrilled
at the simple, romantic lives his
heroes led, paid him handsome
royalties, and subconsciously
shared his opinion that civilization
had taken all the best from
the life of man.</p>

<p>Eric had settled down to the
artistic satisfaction of describing
the sensuous delight of his
hero in the roasted marrow-bones
of a dead mammoth, when
the pretty woman in the other
room stirred, and presently came
tripping into the study, gay and
vivacious, and&mdash;as her husband
of a few months most justly
thought&mdash;altogether beautiful in
a bright silk dressing gown.</p>

<p>Recklessly, he slammed the
machine back into its place, and
resolved to forget that his next
"red-blooded action thriller" was
due in the publisher's office at the
end of the month. He sprang up
to kiss his wife, held her embraced
for a long happy moment.
And then they went hand in
hand, to the side of the room and
punched a series of buttons on a
panel&mdash;a simple way of ordering
breakfast sent up the automatic
shaft from the kitchens below.</p>

<p>Nada Stokes-Harding was also
an author. She wrote poems&mdash;"back
to nature stuff"&mdash;simple
lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of
bird songs, of bright flowers and
warm winds, of thrilling communion
with Nature, and growing
things. Men read her poems
and called her a genius. Even
though the whole world had
grown up into a city, the birds
were extinct, there were no wild
flowers, and no one had time to
bother about sunsets.</p>

<p>"Eric, darling," she said, "isn't
it terrible to be cooped up here
in this little flat, away from the
things we both love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Civilization has
ruined the world. If we could only
have lived a thousand years ago,
when life was simple and natural,
when men hunted and killed their
meat, instead of drinking synthetic
stuff, when men still had
the joys of conflict, instead of
living under glass, like hot-house
flowers."</p>

<p>"If we could only go somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't anywhere to go. I
write about the West, Africa,
South Sea Islands. But they
were all filled up two hundred
years ago. Pleasure resorts, sanatoriums,
cities, factories."</p>

<p>"If only we lived on Venus!
I was listening to a lecture on
the television, last night. The
speaker said that the Planet
Venus is younger than the Earth,
that it has not cooled so much. It
has a thick, cloudy atmosphere,
and low, rainy forests. There's
simple, elemental life there&mdash;like
Earth had before civilization
ruined it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red
ray telescope, that penetrates
the cloud layers of the
planet, proved that Venus rotates
in about the same period as
Earth; and it must be much like
Earth was a million years ago."</p>

<p>"Eric, I wonder if we could go
there! It would be so thrilling to
begin life like the characters in
your stories, to get away from
this hateful civilization, and live
natural lives. Maybe a rocket&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> young author's eyes were
glowing. He skipped across the
floor, seized Nada, kissed her
ecstatically. "Splendid! Think of
hunting in the virgin forest, and
bringing the game home to you!
But I'm afraid there is no way.&mdash;Wait!
The Cosmic Express."</p>

<p>"The Cosmic Express?"</p>

<p>"A new invention. Just perfected
a few weeks ago, I understand.
By Ludwig Von der Valls,
the German physicist."</p>

<p>"I've quit bothering about science.
It has ruined nature, filled
the world with silly, artificial
people, doing silly, artificial
things."</p>

<p>"But this is quite remarkable,
dear. A new way to travel&mdash;by
ether!"</p>

<p>"By ether!"</p>

<p>"Yes. You know of course that
energy and matter are interchangeable
terms; both are simply
etheric vibration, of different
sorts."</p>

<p>"Of course. That's elementary."
She smiled proudly. "I can
give you examples, even of the
change. The disintegration of the
radium atom, making helium
and lead and <i>energy</i>. And Millikan's
old proof that his Cosmic
Ray is generated when particles
of electricity are united to form
an atom."</p>

<p>"Fine! I thought you said you
weren't a scientist." He glowed
with pride. "But the method, in
the new Cosmic Express, is simply
to convert the matter to be
carried into power, send it out
as a radiant beam and focus the
beam to convert it back into
atoms at the destination."</p>

<p>"But the amount of energy
must be terrific&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is. You know short waves
carry more energy than long
ones. The Express Ray is an
electromagnetic vibration of frequency
far higher than that of
even the Cosmic Ray, and correspondingly
more powerful and
more penetrating."</p>

<p>The girl frowned, running slim
fingers through golden-brown
hair. "But I don't see how they
get any recognizable object, not
even how they get the radiation
turned back into matter."</p>

<p>"The beam is focused, just like
the light that passes through a
camera lens. The photographic
lens, using light rays, picks up a
picture and reproduces it again
on the plate&mdash;just the same as
the Express Ray picks up an
object and sets it down on the
other side of the world.</p>

<p>"An analogy from television
might help. You know that by
means of the scanning disc, the
picture is transformed into mere
rapid fluctuations in the brightness
of a beam of light. In a
parallel manner, the focal plane
of the Express Ray moves slowly
through the object, progressively,
dissolving layers of the
thickness of a single atom, which
are accurately reproduced at the
other focus of the instrument&mdash;which
might be in Venus!</p>

<p>"But the analogy of the lens
is the better of the two. For no
receiving instrument is required,
as in television. The object is
built up of an infinite series of
plane layers, at the focus of the
ray, no matter where that may
be. Such a thing would be impossible
with radio apparatus
because even with the best beam
transmission, all but a tiny fraction
of the power is lost, and
power is required to rebuild the
atoms. Do you understand,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether. But I should
worry! Here comes breakfast.
Let me butter your toast."</p>

<p>A bell had rung at the shaft.
She ran to it, and returned with
a great silver tray, laden with
dainty dishes, which she set on a
little side table. They sat down
opposite each other, and ate, getting
as much satisfaction from
contemplation of each other's
faces as from the excellent food.
When they had finished, she carried
the tray to the shaft, slid
it in a slot, and touched a button&mdash;thus
disposing of the culinary
cares of the morning.</p>

<p>She ran back to Eric, who was
once more staring distastefully
at his typewriter.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling! I'm thrilled to
death about the Cosmic Express!
If we could go to Venus, to a new
life on a new world, and get
away from all this hateful conventional
society&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can go to their office&mdash;it's
only five minutes. The chap
that operates the machine for
the company is a pal of mine.
He's not supposed to take passengers
except between the offices
they have scattered about the
world. But I know his weak
point&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eric laughed, fumbled with a
hidden spring under his desk. A
small polished object, gleaming
silvery, slid down into his hand.</p>

<p>"Old friendship, <i>plus</i> this,
would make him&mdash;like spinach."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Five</span> minutes later Mr. Eric
Stokes-Harding and his pretty
wife were in street clothes,
light silk tunics of loose, flowing
lines&mdash;little clothing being required
in the artificially warmed
city. They entered an elevator
and dropped thirty stories to the
ground floor of the great building.</p>

<p>There they entered a cylindrical
car, with rows of seats down
the sides. Not greatly different
from an ancient subway car, except
that it was air-tight, and
was hurled by magnetic attraction
and repulsion through a
tube exhausted of air, at a speed
that would have made an old
subway rider gasp with amazement.</p>

<p>In five more minutes their car
had whipped up to the base of
another building, in the business
section, where there was no room
for parks between the mighty
structures that held the unbroken
glass roofs two hundred stories
above the concrete pavement.</p>

<p>An elevator brought them up a
hundred and fifty stories. Eric
led Nada down a long, carpeted
corridor to a wide glass door,
which bore the words:</p>

<div class="center"><b>COSMIC EXPRESS</b></div>

<p class="noin">stenciled in gold capitals across
it.</p>

<p>As they approached, a lean
man, carrying a black bag, darted
out of an elevator shaft opposite
the door, ran across the corridor,
and entered. They pushed in after
him.</p>

<p>They were in a little room,
cut in two by a high brass grill.
In front of it was a long bench
against the wall, that reminded
one of the waiting room in an old
railroad depot. In the grill was a
little window, with a lazy, brown-eyed
youth leaning on the shelf
behind it. Beyond him was a
great, glittering piece of mechanism,
half hidden by the brass.
A little door gave access to the
machine from the space before
the grill.</p>

<p>The thin man in black, whom
Eric now recognized as a prominent
French heart-specialist, was
dancing before the window, waving
his bag frantically, raving at
the sleepy boy.</p>

<p>"Queek! I have tell you zee
truth! I have zee most urgent
necessity to go queekly. A patient
I have in Paree, zat ees in
zee most creetical condition!"</p>

<p>"Hold your horses just a minute,
Mister. We got a client in
the machine now. Russian diplomat
from Moscow to Rio de
Janeiro.... Two hundred seventy
dollars and eighty cents,
please.... Your turn next. Remember
this is just an experimental
service. Regular installations
all over the world in a year....
Ready now. Come on in."</p>

<p>The youth took the money,
pressed a button. The door
sprang open in the grill, and the
frantic physician leaped through
it.</p>

<p>"Lie down on the crystal, face
up," the young man ordered.
"Hands at your sides, don't
breathe. Ready!"</p>

<p>He manipulated his dials and
switches, and pressed another
button.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Eric, old man!"
he cried. "That's the lady you
were telling me about? Congratulations!"
A bell jangled before
him on the panel. "Just a minute.
I've got a call."</p>

<p>He punched the board again.
Little bulbs lit and glowed for a
second. The youth turned toward
the half-hidden machine, spoke
courteously.</p>

<p>"All right, madam. Walk out.
Hope you found the transit pleasant."</p>

<p>"But my Violet! My precious
Violet!" a shrill female voice
came from the machine. "Sir,
what have you done with my
darling Violet?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, madam.
You lost it off your hat?"</p>

<p>"None of your impertinence,
sir! I want my dog."</p>

<p>"Ah, a dog. Must have jumped
off the crystal. You can have
him sent on for three hundred
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young man, if any harm
comes to my Violet&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll
appeal to the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!"</p>

<p>"Very good, madam. We appreciate
your patronage."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> door flew open again.
A very fat woman, puffing
angrily, face highly colored,
clothing shimmering with artificial
gems, waddled pompously
out of the door through which
the frantic French doctor had
so recently vanished. She rolled
heavily across the room, and out
into the corridor. Shrill words
floated back:</p>

<p>"I'm going to see my lawyer!
My precious Violet&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sallow youth winked.
"And now what can I do for you,
Eric?"</p>

<p>"We want to go to Venus, if
that ray of yours can put us
there."</p>

<p>"To Venus? Impossible. My
orders are to use the Express
merely between the sixteen designated
stations, at New York,
San Francisco, Tokyo, London,
Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, Charley," with a
cautious glance toward the door,
Eric held up the silver flask.
"For old time's sake, and for
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy seemed dazed at sight
of the bright flask. Then, with a
single swift motion, he snatched
it out of Eric's hand, and bent
to conceal it below his instrument
panel.</p>

<p>"Sure, old boy. I'd send you to
heaven for that, if you'd give me
the micrometer readings to set
the ray with. But I tell you, this
is dangerous. I've got a sort of
television attachment, for focusing
the ray. I can turn that on
Venus&mdash;I've been amusing myself,
watching the life there, already.
Terrible place. Savage. I
can pick a place on high land to
set you down. But I can't be responsible
for what happens afterward."</p>

<p>"Simple, primitive life is what
we're looking for. And now what
do I owe you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. Between
friends. Provided that stuff's
genuine! Walk in and lie down on
the crystal block. Hands at your
sides. Don't move."</p>

<p>The little door had swung
open again, and Eric led Nada
through. They stepped into a little
cell, completely surrounded
with mirrors and vast prisms
and lenses and electron tubes. In
the center was a slab of transparent
crystal, eight feet square
and two inches thick, with an
intricate mass of machinery below
it.</p>

<p>Eric helped Nada to a place
on the crystal, lay down at her
side.</p>

<p>"I think the Express Ray is
focused just at the surface of the
crystal, from below," he said. "It
dissolves our substance, to be
transmitted by the beam. It
would look as if we were melting
into the crystal."</p>

<p>"Ready," called the youth.
"Think I've got it for you. Sort
of a high island in the jungle.
Nothing bad in sight now. But,
I say&mdash;how're you coming back?
I haven't got time to watch you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. We aren't coming
back."</p>

<p>"Gee! What is it? Elopement?
I thought you were married already.
Or is it business difficulties?
The Bears did make an awful
raid last night. But you better
let me set you down in Hong
Kong."</p>

<p>A bell jangled. "So long," the
youth called.</p>

<p>Nada and Eric felt themselves
enveloped in fire. Sheets of white
flame seemed to lap up about
them from the crystal block. Suddenly
there was a sharp tingling
sensation where they touched
the polished surface. Then blackness,
blankness.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> next thing they knew, the
fires were gone from about
them. They were lying in something
extremely soft and fluid;
and warm rain was beating in
their faces. Eric sat up, found
himself in a mud-puddle. Beside
him was Nada, opening her eyes
and struggling up, her bright
garments stained with black
mud.</p>

<p>All about rose a thick jungle,
dark and gloomy&mdash;and very wet.
Palm-like, the gigantic trees
were, or fern-like, flinging clouds
of feathery green foliage high
against a somber sky of unbroken
gloom.</p>

<p>They stood up, triumphant.</p>

<p>"At last!" Nada cried. "We're
free! Free of that hateful old
civilization! We're back to Nature!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're on our feet now,
not parasites on the machines."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful to have a fine,
strong man like you to trust in,
Eric. You're just like one of the
heroes in your books!"</p>

<p>"You're the perfect companion,
Nada.... But now we
must be practical. We must
build a fire, find weapons, set up
a shelter of some kind. I guess it
will be night, pretty soon. And
Charley said something about
savage animals he had seen in
the television.</p>

<p>"We'll find a nice dry cave,
and have a fire in front of the
door. And skins of animals to
sleep on. And pottery vessels to
cook in. And you will find seeds
and grown grain."</p>

<p>"But first we must find a flint-bed.
We need flint for tools, and
to strike sparks to make a fire
with. We will probably come
across a chunk of virgin copper,
too&mdash;it's found native."</p>

<p>Presently they set off through
the jungle. The mud seemed to
be very abundant, and of a most
sticky consistence. They sank
into it ankle deep at every step,
and vast masses of it clung to
their feet. A mile they struggled
on, without finding where a provident
nature had left them even
a single fragment of quartz, to
say nothing of a mass of pure
copper.</p>

<p>"A darned shame," Eric grumbled,
"to come forty million
miles, and meet such a reception
as this!"</p>

<p>Nada stopped. "Eric," she
said, "I'm tired. And I don't believe
there's any rock here, anyway.
You'll have to use wooden
tools, sharpened in the fire."</p>

<p>"Probably you're right. This
soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.
Shouldn't be surprised if
the native rock is some hundreds
of feet underground. Your
idea is better."</p>

<p>"You can make a fire by rubbing
sticks together, can't you?"</p>

<p>"It can be done, I'm sure. I've
never tried it, myself. We need
some dry sticks, first."</p>

<p>They resumed the weary
march, with a good fraction of
the new planet adhering to their
feet. Rain was still falling from
the dark heavens in a steady,
warm downpour. Dry wood
seemed scarce as the proverbial
hen's teeth.</p>

<p>"You didn't bring any matches,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Matches! Of course not!
We're going back to Nature."</p>

<p>"I hope we get a fire pretty
soon."</p>

<p>"If dry wood were gold dust,
we couldn't buy a hot dog."</p>

<p>"Eric, that reminds me that
I'm hungry."</p>

<p>He confessed to a few pangs of
his own. They turned their attention
to looking for banana
trees, and coconut palms, but
they did not seem to abound in
the Venerian jungle. Even small
animals that might have been
slain with a broken branch had
contrary ideas about the matter.</p>

<p>At last, from sheer weariness,
they stopped, and gathered
branches to make a sloping shelter
by a vast fallen tree-trunk.</p>

<p>"This will keep out the rain&mdash;maybe&mdash;"
Eric said hopefully.
"And tomorrow, when it has quit
raining&mdash;I'm sure we'll do better."</p>

<p>They crept in, as gloomy night
fell without. They lay in each
other's arms, the body warmth
oddly comforting. Nada cried a
little.</p>

<p>"Buck up," Eric advised her.
"We're back to nature&mdash;where
we've always wanted to be."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> the darkness, the temperature
fell somewhat, and
a high wind rose, whipping cold
rain into the little shelter, and
threatening to demolish it.
Swarms of mosquito-like insects,
seemingly not inconvenienced in
the least by the inclement elements,
swarmed about them in
clouds.</p>

<p>Then came a sound from the
dismal stormy night, a hoarse,
bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.</p>

<p>Nada clung against Eric.
"What is it, dear?" she chattered.</p>

<p>"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur,
or something of the sort. This
world seems to be in about the
same state as the Earth when
they flourished there.... But
maybe it won't find us."</p>

<p>The roar was repeated, nearer.
The earth trembled beneath a
mighty tread.</p>

<p>"Eric," a thin voice trembled.
"Don't you think&mdash;it might have
been better&mdash; You know the old
life was not so bad, after all."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking of our
rooms, nice and warm and
bright, with hot foods coming up
the shaft whenever we pushed
the button, and the gay crowds
in the park, and my old typewriter."</p>

<p>"Eric?" she called softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish&mdash;we had
known better?"</p>

<p>"I do." If he winced at the
"we" the girl did not notice.</p>

<p>The roaring outside was closer.
And suddenly it was answered
by another raucous bellow, at
considerable distance, that echoed
strangely through the forest.
The fearful sounds were repeated,
alternately. And always
the more distant seemed nearer,
until the two sounds were together.</p>

<p>And then an infernal din
broke out in the darkness. Bellows.
Screams. Deafening
shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if
struggling Titans had upset
oceans. Thunderous crashes, as
if they were demolishing forests.</p>

<p>Eric and Nada clung to each
other, in doubt whether to stay
or to fly through the storm.
Gradually the sound of the conflict
came nearer, until the earth
shook beneath them, and they
were afraid to move.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great fallen tree
against which they had erected
the flimsy shelter was rolled
back, evidently by a chance blow
from the invisible monsters. The
pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled
humans. Nada burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only&mdash;if only&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Suddenly</span> flame lapped up
about them, the same white
fire they had seen as they lay on
the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility
overcame them. A few
moments later, they were lying
on the transparent table in the
Cosmic Express office, with all
those great mirrors and prisms
and lenses about them.</p>

<p>A bustling, red-faced official
appeared through the door in the
grill, fairly bubbling apologies.</p>

<p>"So sorry&mdash;an accident&mdash;inconceivable.
I can't see how he
got it! We got you back as soon
as we could find a focus. I sincerely
hope you haven't been injured."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why I happened in, found
our operator drunk. I've no idea
where he got the stuff. He muttered
something about Venus. I
consulted the auto-register, and
found two more passengers registered
here than had been recorded
at our other stations. I
looked up the duplicate beam coordinates,
and found that it had
been set on Venus. I got men on
the television at once, and we
happened to find you.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine how it happened.
I've had the fellow locked
up, and the 'dry-laws' are on the
job. I hope you won't hold us for
excessive damages."</p>

<p>"No, I ask nothing except that
you don't press charges against
the boy. I don't want him to suffer
for it in any way. My wife and
I will be perfectly satisfied to get
back to our apartment."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder. You look like
you've been through&mdash;I don't
know what. But I'll have you
there in five minutes. My private car&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb2" />

<p>Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding, noted
author of primitive life and love,
ate a hearty meal with his pretty
spouse, after they had washed
off the grime of another planet.
He spent the next twelve hours
in bed.</p>

<p>At the end of the month he
delivered his promised story to
his publishers, a thrilling tale of
a man marooned on Venus, with
a beautiful girl. The hero made
stone tools, erected a dwelling
for himself and his mate, hunted
food for her, defended her from
the mammoth saurian monsters
of the Venerian jungles.</p>

<p>The book was a huge success.</p>
